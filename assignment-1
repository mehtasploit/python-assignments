Python -Assignment 1 

 

1)Create a variable named carname and assign the value Volvo to it. 
carname = "Volvo"
 
2)Multiply 10 with 5, and print the result. 
print(10*5)
 
3)what will be the output of print 9//2 and why? 
print(9//2) = 8 
because "//" considers floor number
 
4)Create a string, an integer, and a floating point number. The string should be named mystring and should contain the word "hello". 
The floating point number should be named myfloat and should contain the number 10.0, and the integer should be named myint and should contain the number 20. 
mystring = "hello"
myint = 20
myfloat = 10.0
 
5)What is the output of the following assignment operator 
y = 10 
x =y +2 
print(x) 

 12

6)What is the output of the following code 
x = 100 
y = 50 
print(x * y) 

 5000

7)What is the output of print(2%6) 
2
 
8)How would you check if each word in a string begins with a capital letter? 
mystring = "Hello world"
mystring.isupper()
 
9) Count the total number of characters in a string 
mystring = "Hello World"
len(mystring)
 
10) Split a string on a specific character(Use space as a delimiter in any string) 
word = 'CatBatSatFatOr'
  
# Splitting at t
print(word.split('t'))
 
11)Uppercase or lowercase an entire string. 
string = "Hello world"
string.upper()
 
12)What is the effect of multiplying a string by 3? 
string = "Hello world"
pring(string[3:7])
print(string*3)
 
13)Concatenate two strings 
s1 = "hello"
s2 = "world"
print (s1+s2)
 
14)prints the characters of string from 3 to 7 skipping one character. 
string = "Hello world"
print(string[3:8])
print(string[3:8:1])
 
15)what is the output of print "Hello World"[::-1] and why? 
dlroW olleH
